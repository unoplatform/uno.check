# Uno.Check

[![NuGet](https://badgen.net/nuget/v/Uno.Check)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uno.Check)

**Uno.Check** is a cross-platform, command-line .NET tool that validates and configures your development environment in a single step.
Once installed as a global tool, it runs a series of “checkups”, reports any missing or misconfigured components, and can apply automatic fixes.
Designed to simplify setup and ensures you have everything you need to build and debug Uno apps with confidence.

To install the tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Uno.Check
```

To update the tool, if you already have an existing one:

```bash
dotnet tool update -g uno.check
```

To run the tool:

```bash
uno-check
```
